The data and scripts are used to reproduce the results of the paper "AGI-Enabled Biconnectivity-Preserving Flocking with Fast Obstacle Avoidance for UAV Swarms in Low Altitude"

The .py scripts are used to read the simulation data stored in the "result" folder and then plot figures that are shown in the manuscript.

The .jpg files are generated by the .py scripts.

Descriptions of the figures are listed below:

(figures in this folder--->figures in the manuscript)
1.fig_train_reward.jpg--->Fig. 7. During training, reward changes of the direction determination of rotational repulsive forces algorithm based on PPO in rectangular and circular obstacle environments.
2.fig_four_simulation_results.jpg--->Fig. 8. Illustration of the simulation results: (a) The UAV swarm based on BPF-FOA maintains network biconnectivity and reaches the target area without collision; (b) The UAV swarm based on CPF-OA moves back and forth in front of the obstacle and does not reach the target area; (c) Collision between two green UAVs occurs when the UAV swarm based on CPF-OA passes through a narrow obstacle gap; (d) The UAV swarm based on BPF-OA moves back and forth in front of the obstacle and does not reach the target area.
